# Causal-Inference-Spring-2021

In this workshop, we will focus on skills for causal inference. First, we will walk through a basic t-test, then we will dive into regression analysis, which is used for both observational and experimental studies. This will include basic regression as well as how to incorporate interaction terms and fixed effects. Finally, we will learn how to implement Matching and Regression Discontinuity (and potentially Instrumental Variables) in R. 

## Workshop Materials

The materials include two slides: 1) Matching; and 2) RDD. Also included is an R project file and necessary dataset.
